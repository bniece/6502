Timing tests:

(using em6502 > out.txt)
noV-abs
MSVC: 2 min 45.828 s
MSYS2: 40.956 s
Debian: 38.046 s

noV-zpg
MSVC: 2 min 44.810 s
MSYS2: 40.529 s
Debian: 38.636 s

Debian is much less consistent run-to-run.  Maybe because it is in a VM.
I wonder if the redirected code trace is why MSVC is so much slower.  
(Tried in a CLI Debian VM.  Slightly faster, but no more consistent.)
I will add an option to silence that.
