Timing tests:

(using em6502 > out.txt)
noV-abs
MSVC: 2 min 45.828 s
MSYS2: 40.956 s
Debian: 38.046 s

noV-zpg
MSVC: 2 min 44.810 s
MSYS2: 40.529 s
Debian: 38.636 s

Debian is much less consistent run-to-run.  Maybe because it is in a VM.
(Tried in a CLI Debian VM.  Slightly faster, but no more consistent.)
I wonder if the redirected code trace is why MSVC is so much slower.  
I will add an option to silence that.

(using -C 0 -D 0 -S 0 -Z 0 -L 0)
noV-abs
MSVC: 0.731 s
MSYS2: 0.698 s
Debian: 2.018 s

noV-abs
MSVC: 0.673 s
MSYS2: 0.640 s
Debian: 1.884 s

The Debian VM was still a little less consistent, but better. 
MSVC is much improved.  Still a bit slower than the gcc version, but that
may be because I have to run it in MSYS to time it.
